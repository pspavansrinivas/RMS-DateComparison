# Project Title

Spring Boot application with Thymeleaf template engine and Bootstrap front-end framework.

The application should provide a UI form with two input fields as start date and end date, and a Confirm button to submit the form and display the number of days between the two date inputs.

If the end date is before the start date, the application should display an error message and the message text should be defined externally.
